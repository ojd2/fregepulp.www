    				With the preceding discussion, we may appreciate the intellectual context of our proposal which is, 
    				the generalization of Heytings conception of semantics to functional calculi specifically the A-Calculus. 
    				The proposal carries a serious import: semantics, and specifically 
					formal semantics, is salient to any language and only to language; the A-Calculus is a formal 
					language and has already, a Tarskian (or denotational) semantics formulated principally by 
					D. S. Scott.</p>

					<p>Meditation on the instant thus convinces us that oblivion is most brutal the more recent the past it destroys, 
					just as uncertainty is most poignant when placed along the axis of a thought to come, of a still fervent yet already
					 broken dream, yet without ever losing that dominant characteristic of being novelty.</p>
