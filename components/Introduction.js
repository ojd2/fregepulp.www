			    		<h1>Frege & the concept of Sense</h1>
			    		
						<h2>
						It may justifiably be said of Frege that his most radical contribution to philosophy 
						was the definition of its foundational question to be the theory of meaning (or logic in his terminology) 
						and not epistemology as posited by Descartes.
						</h2>
						
						<p>
						This was his basic intellectual project and it was articulated through his 
						philosophical commitment to free Kant's conception of a priori knowledge from 
						every trace of the pure intuition that had been conceived as its ground.
						This articulation was itself achieved through a subtle shift in focus: in Kants conception, analytic a 
						priori knowledge was rather trivial it was the synthetic a priori which was really a profound matter, 
						and which required the ground of pure intuition. </p>
